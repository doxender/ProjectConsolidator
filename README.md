Little utility project for model tuning an AI with your entire project code.

Crawls either an Android or Visual C++ project and adds the relivent files to an XML taged xml file with your choice of name.  You can then copy the xml and put it into an AI as a prompt.  Thereafter, you will be able to talk to the AI about the entire project.
